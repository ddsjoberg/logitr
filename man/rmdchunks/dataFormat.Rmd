The {logitr} package requires that data be structured in a  `data.frame` and arranged in a "long" format [@Wickham2014] such that each row is an alternative from a choice observation. The choice observations do not have to be symmetric, meaning they can have a "ragged" structure where different choice observations have different numbers of alternatives. The data must also include variables for each of the following:

- **Outcome**: A dummy variable that identifies the positive / selected alternative with a `1` and negative / not selected alternative(s) with a `0`. Only one alternative should have `1` per observation.
- **Observation ID**: A sequence of repeated numbers that identifies each unique choice observation. For example, if the first three choice observations had 2 alternatives each, then the first 6 rows of the `obsID` variable would be `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3`.
- **Covariates**: Other variables that will be used as model covariates.
