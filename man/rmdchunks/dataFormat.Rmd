The `data` argument must be provided a `data.frame` arranged in "long" or "tidy" format [@Wickham2014]. Each row should be an alternative from a choice observation. The choice observations do not have to be symmetric (i.e. each choice observation could have a different number of alternatives). The data must also include variables for each of the following arguments in the `logitr()` function:

- `choice`: A dummy variable that identifies which alternative was chosen (`1` is chosen, `0` is not chosen). Only one alternative should be chosen per choice observation.
- `obsID`: A sequence of repeated numbers that identifies each unique choice observation For example, if the first three choice observations had 2 alternatives each, then the first 6 rows of the `obsID` variable would be `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3`.
- `pars`: The names of the variables that will be used as model covariates. For WTP space models, the price variable should **not** be included in `pars` as it is provided separately with the `price` argument.
