\usage{
\method{predict}{logitr}(
  object,
  newdata = NULL,
  obsID = NULL,
  type = "probs",
  returnData = TRUE,
  ci = NULL,
  numDrawsCI = 10^3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{is an object of class \code{logitr}.}

\item{newdata}{a \code{data.frame}. Each row is an alternative and each column an
attribute corresponding to parameter names in the estimated model. Defaults
to \code{NULL}, in which case predictions are made on the original data used to
estimate the model.}

\item{obsID}{The name of the column that identifies each set of
alternatives in the data. Required if predicting results for more than one
set of alternatives. Defaults to \code{NULL}, in which case the value for \code{obsID}
from the estimated \code{object} is used.}

\item{type}{A character vector defining what to predict: \code{probs} for
probabilities, \code{choices} for choices. If you want both outputs, use
\code{c("probs", "choices")}. Choices are predicted randomly according to the
predicted probabilities. Defaults to \code{"probs"}.}

\item{returnData}{If \code{TRUE} the data is also returned, otherwise only the
predicted values ("probs" and / or  "choices") are returned.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{ci}{If a confidence interval (CI) for the predicted probabilities is
desired, set \code{ci} to a number between 0 and 1 to define the CI sensitivity.
For example, \code{ci = 0.95} will return a 95\% CI. Defaults to \code{NULL}, in which
case no CI is computed.}

\item{numDrawsCI}{The number of draws to use in simulating uncertainty
for the computed CI. Defaults to 10^3.}
}
\value{
A data frame of predicted probabilities and / or choices.
}
\description{
This method is used for computing predicted probabilities and / or choices
for either the data used for model estimation or a new data set consisting
of a single or multiple sets of alternatives.

\examples{
library(logitr)

# Estimate a preference space model
mnl_pref <- logitr(
  data   = yogurt,
  choice = "choice",
  obsID  = "obsID",
  pars   = c("price", "feat", "brand")
)

# Predict probabilities

# Create a set of alternatives for which to predict choice probabilities.
# Each row is an alternative and each column an attribute. In this example,
# two of the choice observations from the yogurt dataset are used
newdata <- subset(
    yogurt, obsID \%in\% c(42, 13),
    select = c('obsID', 'alt', 'price', 'feat', 'brand'))
newdata

# Predict choice probabilities using the estimated model
predict(mnl_pref, newdata, obsID = "obsID")

# Predict choices and probabilities using the estimated model
predict(mnl_pref, newdata, obsID = "obsID", choices = TRUE)
