#' Choice observations of yogurt purchases by 100 households
#'
#' Data from Jain et al. (1994) containing 2,412 choice observations from a
#' series of yogurt purchases by a panel of 100 households in Springfield,
#' Missouri, over a roughly two-year period. The data were collected by
#' optical scanners and contain information about the price, brand, and a
#' "feature" variable, which identifies whether a newspaper advertisement was
#' shown to the customer. There are four brands of yogurt: Yoplait, Dannon,
#' Weight Watchers, and Hiland, with market shares of 34%, 40%, 23% and 3%,
#' respectively.
