Once a model has been estimated, it can be used to predict probabilities and / or choices for a set of alternatives. This vignette demonstrates examples of how to so using the `predict()` method along with an estimated model.

You can make predictions for any set of alternatives, so long as the columns in the alternatives correspond to estimated coefficients in your model. By default, if no new data are provided via the `newdata` argument, then predictions will be made for the original data used to estimate the model.

Predictions can be made using both preference space and WTP space models, as well as multinomial logit and mixed logit models. For mixed logit models, heterogeneity is modeled by simulating draws from the population estimates of the estimated model.

# Predicting probabilities

## Preference space models

In the example below, a preference space MNL model is estimated (`mnl_pref`) and then used to predict probabilities for the data used to estimate the model:

```{r}
mnl_pref <- logitr(
  data   = yogurt,
  choice = 'choice',
  obsID  = 'obsID',
  pars   = c('price', 'feat', 'brand')
)

probs <- predict(mnl_pref)
head(probs)
```

The `predict()` method returns a data frame containing the observation ID as well as the predicted probabilities. Should you want the original data to also be returned in the data frame, set `returnData = TRUE`:

```{r}
probs <- predict(mnl_pref, returnData = TRUE)
head(probs)
```

To make predictions for a new set of alternatives, use the `newdata` argument. As an example, we can use two of the choice observations from the `yogurt` dataset:

```{r}
data <- subset(
  yogurt, obsID %in% c(42, 13),
  select = c('obsID', 'alt', 'price', 'feat', 'brand'))

probs_mnl_pref <- predict(
  mnl_pref,
  newdata = data,
  obsID = "obsID",
)

probs_mnl_pref
```

You can also obtain the upper and lower bounds of a confidence interval for predicted probabilities by including the `ci` argument. For example, a 95% CI is obtained with `ci = 0.95`:

```{r}
probs_mnl_pref <- predict(
  mnl_pref,
  newdata = data,
  obsID = "obsID",
  ci = 0.95
)

probs_mnl_pref
```

The lower and upper bounds computed reflect a confidence interval estimated using the Krinsky and Robb parametric bootstrapping method [@Krinsky1986].

## WTP space models

WTP space models estimated using `logitr()` can also be used to predict probabilities. The only additional requirement is that if predictions are being made on a different data set using `newdata`, you must use the `price` argument to specify the column in `newdata` that corresponds to "price". In the example below, a WTP space model is estimated and used to predict probabilities for the same `data` data frame as in the previous examples:

```{r}
mnl_wtp <- logitr(
  data       = yogurt,
  choice     = 'choice',
  obsID      = 'obsID',
  pars       = c('feat', 'brand'),
  price      = 'price',
  modelSpace = 'wtp',
  numMultiStarts = 10
)

probs_mnl_wtp <- predict(
  mnl_wtp,
  newdata = data,
  obsID = "obsID",
  price = "price",
  ci = 0.95
)

probs_mnl_wtp
```

Here is a bar chart comparing the predicted choice probabilities from the preference space and WTP space models. Since both models are equivalent except in different spaces, the predicted choice probabilities are identical:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

probs <- rbind(probs_mnl_pref, probs_mnl_wtp)
probs$model <- c(rep("mnl_pref", 8), rep("mnl_wtp", 8))
probs$alt <- rep(c("dannon", "hiland", "weight", "yoplait"), 4)
probs$obs <- paste0("Observation ID: ", probs$obsID)
ggplot(probs, aes(x = alt, y = prob_predict, fill = model)) +
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity', width = 0.7, position = "dodge") +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = prob_predict_lower, ymax = prob_predict_upper),
                  width = 0.2, position = position_dodge(width = 0.7)) +
    facet_wrap(vars(obs)) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +
    labs(x = 'Alternative', y = 'Expected Choice Probabilities') +
    theme_bw()
```

```{r probabilities, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('probs.png')
```

# Predicting choices

You can also use the `predict()` method to predict choices. To do this, set `type = "choices"` (which defaults to `"probs"` for returning predicted probabilities). Again, if no new data are provided for the `newdata` argument, then choices will be predicted for every alternative in the original data used to estimate the model.

In the examples below the `returnData` argument is also set to `TRUE` so that the predicted choices can be compared to the actual ones. Here are two sets of predictions, one using the estimated preference space model and the other using the WTP space model. The predicted choices may vary across different iterations of the same code since they are chosen according to the predicted probabilities, and thus there is a chance other choices may be made.

```{r}
choices_mnl_pref <- predict(mnl_pref, type = "choices", returnData = TRUE)
head(choices_mnl_pref)

choices_mnl_wtp <- predict(mnl_wtp, type = "choices", returnData = TRUE)
head(choices_mnl_wtp)
```

The accuracy of each model can be computed by dividing the number of correctly predicted choices by the total number of choices:

```{r}
chosen_pref <- subset(choices_mnl_pref, choice == 1)
chosen_pref$correct <- chosen_pref$choice == chosen_pref$choice_predict
accuracy_pref <- sum(chosen_pref$correct) / nrow(chosen_pref)
accuracy_pref

chosen_wtp <- subset(choices_mnl_wtp, choice == 1)
chosen_wtp$correct <- chosen_wtp$choice == chosen_wtp$choice_predict
accuracy_wtp <- sum(chosen_wtp$correct) / nrow(chosen_wtp)
accuracy_wtp
```

These results show that both models correctly predicted choice for approximately `r scales::percent(round(accuracy_pref, 2))` of the observations in the `yogurt` data frame, which is significantly better than random (25%).
